This Github shows the creation of the STGNN model used in SÃ¶lvi's and Thorir's Thesis: Forecasting Flight Delays with Machine Learning
(Flight Delay Prediction with Uncertainty: A Comparative Study of TreeBased, Sequential,
and SpatioTemporal Graph Neural Network Models).

You'll need to run Kaggle_data.ipynb in order to run STGNN.ipynb.
